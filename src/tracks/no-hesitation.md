The clock's a bit fast
I'm wondering if I can believe it
What's holding me back?
What's making me act like I can't see it?
No heart in my chest
Pretending I'm not my happiest

No Hesitation
The sooner
The better that you're mine
Thought I was patient
But maybe
I just don't have the time

I'm taking the stairs
I must've been scared of elevators
A rush to the top
Avoiding the stops that make us later
The view from the roof
Is better when sharing it with you

No Hesitation
The sooner
The better that you're mine
Thought I was patient
But maybe
I just don't have the time

Think of all the years I could've thrown away
When teaming up was
All I dreamed of

No Hesitation
The sooner
The better that you're mine
