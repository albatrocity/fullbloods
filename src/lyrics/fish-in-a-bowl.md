I guess you wanna sit here
But I don't want to move
Plus I got here first
That's just how it works
Someone tell this jerk

Fish in a bowl
I'll be sure you have nowhere to go

The seating was strategic
The distance from the aisle
I measured just enough
Space here for my stuff
I went the extra mile

You must have seen it
I'm inconvenienced
And I want you to know
