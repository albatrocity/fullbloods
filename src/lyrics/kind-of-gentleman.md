Start pouring the drinks that nobody wants me to  
Keep them around for a little while  
"Shut up, you don’t know anything anyone wants to hear”  
Dial it down and manage a smile

Be my own kind of gentleman  
When I don’t belong  
I know I’m taking too much / Can’t seem like I’m losing my touch

Just settle the room and wait until things are done  
That elephant can’t catch a break  
I try to choose the battles that already have been won  
Pretending there’s so much at stake
