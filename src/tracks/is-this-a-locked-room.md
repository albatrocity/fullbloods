Wasting on the couch  
I was asked if I’d like to go out  
Nonsense, man  
I’m still watching movies

I know what it’s about  
I’m a slave to the habit of doubt  
Like my best friends  
I’m still chasing groupies

So when a leaf falls  
Does it touch the ground?  
And when the sun is out  
Does it warm my skin?
When the bride calls  
Does she receive her groom?  
Or is this a locked room?

The jury sure is grim  
But the the final verdict is in  
Guess I’m guilty now  
Thank you all for asking  
Stands to reason when  
I forfeit before I begin  
That I wonder why  
Nothing ever happens
