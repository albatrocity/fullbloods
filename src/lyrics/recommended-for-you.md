Awake without intention
I sense the morning light
Sheltered in the shadow of a million satellites
Launched to let me know about the sun shining bright
Through the window of my dwelling
With all the blinds shut tight

Planning for the evening
To wrap it up by nine
I consult an old familiar catalog of mine
Searching for direction on investment in time
Have you seen this one already?
What have you read online?

When your mind's full
Keep it simple
Recommended for you
No decisions
Need forgiven
Recommended for you

When I do my research
I pull it into view
Subatomic athletes run a marathon to you
Carrying a message so it sits in your queue
Ideas about our dinner?
What sounds good to you?

When your mind's full
Keep it simple
Recommended for you
No decisions
Need forgiven
Recommended for you

When your mind's full
Keep it simple
Recommended for you
No decisions
Need forgiven
Recommended for you
Cuz it's recommended for you
Cuz it's recommended for you
