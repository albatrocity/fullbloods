Traveling could be real  
If you had a set of wheels  
That you could consider your own  
Visit me anytime  
Leave your hometown for mine  
I’m guessing you probably won’t

With no keys, no car  
When times are hard  
Stay where you are  
No keys, no car

I can blame time and space  
For keeping me from your face  
Sometimes I wish it would end Maybe it’s not so bad  
Thinking of talks we’ve had  
We’re keeping pretty good friends
