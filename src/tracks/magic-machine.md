Get things moving
Doesn't matter how
The brakes are working
But they're useless now

I gave it my all so many times
I thought it was broken
I'm trying to make it turn out right
But I'm all out of tokens

Hey
It's a magic machine
Generate a new beginning for me
(x3)
It's something you want
It's something you need

Recreational tripping
No one questions what you see
Why not afford this business
The very same opportunity?
Hallucination, hallucination
The screen never fades to black
I put all the stupid things in
And I'll get all the smart things back

Hey
It's a magic machine
Generate a new beginning for me
Hey
It's a magic machine
Generate a better vision of me
Hey
It's a magic machine
Generate some better lyrics for me
Hey
It's a magic machine
It's something you want
It's something you need
