Make some space in your mind for the finer things  
And adjust what's important to you  
Set aside all the dull and the boring  
All of this will be passing soon

When the new generation comes  
Don't you want to live forever?

All your time spent recording the finer things  
In some hopes that we'd see it as you  
What's the cost of a life stored in memory?  
Can we put you together again?

All the output of your mind  
Does it define you?  
Is it really you?
