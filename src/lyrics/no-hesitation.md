The clock’s a bit fast
And I’m wondering how the years are passing
It’s holding me back
But it doesn’t excuse the way I am
No heart in my chest
Pretending I’m not my happiest

No Hesitation
The sooner, the better that you’re mine
Thought I was patient
But maybe I just don’t have the time

I’m taking the stairs
But I wanna be racing elevators
Let’s get to the top
Gonna see that other stuff anyway later
The view from the roof
Is better when sharing it with you

Think of all the years I could've thrown away
When teaming up was all I dreamed of
