No surprise they laid out on the grass  
Enjoyed what was left of the sun  
Would be great to take a shot of that  
So you’d know where it came from

But the spectrum shifted out of day  
Disguising the subject from you  
From the brightest pink to bluest grey  
Before you would move

And once again  
Retire to the comfort of holding everything  
In your hand

It’s time to divvy up, man  
Now that you want someone of your own  
What things you do together  
And what you do alone  
You try to live it up, man  
But it can take more work than you’ve shown  
What things you do together  
And what you do alone

Since you can’t make time for everyone  
wanting a piece of your day  
You can simplify the way it’s done  
Or try anyway
