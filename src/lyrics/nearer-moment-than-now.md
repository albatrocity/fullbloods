Punctured the surface  
Made up my mind to ignore it  
And watch the future appear  
A vision perfectly clear

Hoped I could mention  
All my sincerest intentions  
If I could just go without  
A nearer moment than now

When the burning lights glow  
Thanks for bringing me back from wherever I go  
I'll be there again, you know...soon  
And I'll be with you

What's at the end of this path?  
This silence on my behalf  
A mist becoming a cloud  
A nearer moment than now
