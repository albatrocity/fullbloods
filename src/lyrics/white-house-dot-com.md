I know what I've gotta do
To answer what I'm being asked
I've gotta research, doing the research
A primary source or two
To write up my initial draft
But hold on,
This isn't William Taft


White House dot com
So easy to stumble upon
When you started to sort
Through your traffic report
Did you see that my middle school
Made it on

White House dot com
I should've known that it wouldn't be long
When you're searching for something
You don't have to dig
For a relevant answer when the world is so big


I show it to some of my friends
They know exactly what it is
I've heard about it, hearing about it
Distinguishes grown up men
From unassuming little kids
But hold on,
Why am I seeing this?
