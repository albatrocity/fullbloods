Here we have a treaty renowned  
Disguised as a hand  
Extended to give what it can

It offered a safe place to go  
By wrapping itself around the throat and clenching down

Nobody's fighting you  
You're acting like you won't stand up for me now  
A simple thing to do  
I wonder why you won't stand up for me now

Button up and don't make a sound  
A whisper could cause  
Irreparable damage and loss

Better to keep things quiet  
Don't want to be tied to all the new things going down

I don't understand it  
There must be something on your mind  
I didn't think the things we shared  
Were enough to make you want to hide

Can't help thinking you don't see me real enough to recognize  
Patterns in the way you treat the feelings of the other guys
