Couple of laughs when you’re near me  
I try to get them when I can  
Still waking up and you hear me  
Beginning to question where I am

Could take years to recognize  
What could easily be shrugged away

Showing up  
Is fine  
Met you in person  
Had a good time  
What a pair we made  
Present by proxy  
Conscious by trade

Stare at my mind  
too busy asking  
what about faces in my hand?  
Who do I know?  
These projections  
Exist in the spaces that I can’t

Travel past the moment  
Another word escapes the air

Photo for reference  
You are touching up the edges  
Why does it seem like the paint will never dry?  
Careful as always  
Set the beat without the measure  
And watch it dissolve like a tear in the back of your mind
