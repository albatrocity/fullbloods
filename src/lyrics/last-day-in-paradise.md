Got all my footwear
Off the racks
The dresser is empty
It's on my back
Now's there only one thing left to do
Something I've been looking forward to

Last day in paradise
And here I am looking at all the merchandise
Picking mine

It's not very often
We get away
So I'm looking for something
To feel like we stayed
Longer than it took to get unwound
Soon enough we're homeward bound

Last day in paradise
And here I am looking at all the merchandise
Picking mine
Last day in paradise
And here I am looking at all the merchandise
Thinking twice

Last day in paradise
And here I am looking at all the merchandise
Picking mine
Last day in paradise
And here I am looking at all the merchandise
Thinking twice
