From flesh to bone
Digging up all that's fractured
No heart, no home
Building a body backwards

Who's left after they finally disappear?
Don't it seem quiet now that there's nobody here?
Who's left? Must be the ones who did you wrong
You're doing the dirty work now that everybody's gone

Breaking the ground is always harder
Wearing the boots of someone else

Who's left after they finally disappear?
Don't it seem quiet now that there's nobody here?
Who's left? Must be the ones who did you wrong
You're doing the dirty work now that everybody's gone

When the earth starts shaking
That's your making
