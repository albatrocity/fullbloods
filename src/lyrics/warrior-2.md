Free myself enough to stand
From the morning's frozen hand
Something's gotta give
I don't wanna live like this

Looking for a way to improve
Safe inside my private room
With no one looking in
No one calling me a fool

But I can't really see what you're doing
And I've gotta follow through
How's my warrior two?

Do my best to keep up slack
But I can tell you're holding back
No need to get along
Just tell me what I'm doing wrong

Cuz I can't really see what you're doing
And I've gotta follow through
How's my warrior two?

If I really think I've got it
Would you tell me true
What I'm trying to do
Is enough for you?
