Got all my footwear
Off the racks
The dresser is empty
It's on my back

Now's there only one thing left to do
Something I've been looking forward to

Last day in paradise
And here I am looking at all the merchandise
Pickin' mine

It's not very often
We get away
I'm looking for something
To feel like we stayed

Longer than it took get unwound
Soon enough we're homeward bound
