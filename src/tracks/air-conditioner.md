Turn on my air conditioner  
Put my jacket on  
Enjoy the world I've created  
It won't last for long

I'll be in my bedroom  
Where my bourbon hides  
Don't need more of the great outdoors  
It feels good inside

I don't take vacations  
My summers don't last that long  
I went away somewhere to stay  
But I don't know where I've gone

Feel like a cowboy  
on the lonesome trail  
in the Mild West  
where I belong  
It's a stupid feeling  
I know  
But I'm old enough  
To realize  
That it's not what's going on
