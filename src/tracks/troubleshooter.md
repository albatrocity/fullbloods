Your TV feels a little bright
The room could use some ambient light
You might try to turn the volume down
To grant more headroom for the sound

How long
Tell me when
Will I last
While in this condition?

Well look at me
I'm trying to fix things
And I just can't help myself
Troubleshooting
You won't have to ask for help
Troubleshooter
