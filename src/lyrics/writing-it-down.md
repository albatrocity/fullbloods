This never happens, you thought
As you tried to remember what you just forgot
Marking every doorway in your path
Should you ever need to go back

Try to convince it to stay
Close your eyes and watch it slip away
Searching for the mountains of the past
While skating on a field of glass

Laugh at the stories you're hearing
Thinking the good ones will stick around
Nice try
Say your goodbyes
Nobody's writing it down

The concentration makes you wince
As you chase the thought of it with every sense
Hoping to feel it all again
Regardless of the shape it's in

Laugh at the stories you're hearing
Thinking the good ones will stick around
Nice try
Say your goodbyes
Nobody's writing it down
