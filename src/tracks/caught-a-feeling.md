Startled by your nervous reaction  
Compromised my attitude

Who knows how any of this happens?  
Who knows what any of this means?

Caught a feeling  
Made it mine

Stood in line for the latest attraction  
Wondered why it made me blue

Don't mind emotions  
Most of the times  
But I like to choose which ones  
Distract me from just being fine
