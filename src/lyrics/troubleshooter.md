Your TV feels a little bright
The room could use some ambient light

Might try to bring the volume down
And grant more headroom for the sound

How long,
Tell me when
Will I last
While in this condition?

Well look at me
I'm trying to fix things
Ultimately
What good is it doing?
Well look at me
Troubleshooter
