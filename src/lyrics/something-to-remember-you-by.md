Halfway in  
I know you're joking  
We can all have a laugh before the punchlineâ€™s thrown

It begins  
The doors are open  
And now there's a crowd that you can call your own

Wear a crooked nose  
or a twitching eye  
Hoping there is something I can notice to remember you by  
If you'd like to know  
I would like to try  
Hoping there is something I can notice to remember you by

Almost done  
Now you're saying  
There's a chance I could take your wonderful damage home

There it went  
It's impossible to know  
How much time was spent  
Once I see you go
