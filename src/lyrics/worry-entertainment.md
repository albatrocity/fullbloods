You paid close attention, It all started making sense  
The world's going crazy and there's no saving it

You've read all about it, you'll never be surprised  
It'll naturally happen before it is televised  
when you

Forget about the things you share with human kind  
Worry Entertainment for your idle mind

You've talked the matters over with your friends  
They point to what will clearly be the end

The fools that surround you, blind to the evidence,  
Are ruled by the shallow pool of their ignorance
