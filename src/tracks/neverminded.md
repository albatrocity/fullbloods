The seventh wonder of the world  
Took me so long to find it  
Too much attention from the girl  
We got lost and neverminded

The softest mention of the word  
Cuts me off  
So undecided

If one of us isn’t guilty  
Then one of us is to blame

Nobody tells you when you’ve got it  
Everybody tells you when you’re wrong
