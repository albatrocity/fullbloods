Pull the thread  
Looking straight ahead  
You think it's a bad trick  
To only see  
What you want to see  
Itâ€™s magic

I treat you like a winter coat  
I need you when it's cold  
And nothing else can keep me warm  
But come summertime  
I'm leaving you behind  
There's nothing else I need you for

You want to stay  
That's okay  
It's a habit  
You set the scene  
You want the dream  
You can have it

We could make a little home  
Where it's just us two  
Love in a vacuum  
And when I want to be alone  
All that I'd have to do  
Is look away from you

You looks the same when I shut the door  
You're my favorite winter coat
