The bills come rolling  
They say the rent’s past due  
I don’t try to challenge authority  
I don’t dispute

I don’t want to worry  
Money ain’t no object

They make it easy on me  
Don’t have to visit the store  
No need to speak to anyone  
Then it’s at my door

Wonder what all the rest of my friends do  
I bet they don’t ignore the problem  
Confront what they need to
