Gonna use the dryer now
Gonna dry the sheets and towels
But there is something disconnected
I can't ignore the way I left it
Metal hose hangs near the vent
Metal shelf above it's bent
As I'm completing my correction
I start bleeding

That bump on the head
Split my now and then
Turning my fingers red
That bump on the head
Gave me justice for
Wishing that I was dead

Little kid composure shook
Little pain was all it took
For my little world to feel its edges
And a change in my perspective

That bump on the head
Split my now and then
Turning my fingers red
That bump on the head
Gave me justice for
Wishing that I was dead

Wonder what message I would've sent
Being vindictive to myself
I wonder what kind of punishment
That I would have dealt
