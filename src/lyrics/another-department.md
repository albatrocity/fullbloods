Two double queen beds
Right?
Tonight?
So if that's all you need then
I could let you go

Don't you think of hanging up

Let me transfer you to another department
There's a special offer you'll wanna know
They'll take care of you in the other department
Thanks for calling

We've got our eyes out
Someone just like you
You haven't noticed
You're not going to

Don't you think of hanging up

Let me transfer you to another department
There's a special offer you'll wanna know
They'll take care of you in the other department
Thanks for calling
Now please stay on the phone
