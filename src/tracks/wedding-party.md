Buckle you in so you won’t appear to be  
a swig or two short of full liquidity  
And here I stand, I’ve got nothing left to plea  
You want what you want, and won’t listen to me

I’ve heard about this side of you again and again  
but never saw it till today  
It’s great that after all this time we’re finally friends  
But now you’re pushing me away

Wedding Party  
Left you with me

Something we know, but I’m now inclined to say  
You’re not in the shape to take yourself away

Get together, celebrate, everyone is here  
Time to dance and stay up late, live another year  
Reach out to me on your way  
Travel safely home  
Meet again another day  
Now it’s time to go
