Open channels here  
Echoing in my head  
When you lean against  
My side  
Steady nerves appear  
Hardly a word is said  
Can you be consoled  
by the things that I can’t hide?

Anima Mundi all around  
I want to know what you’re giving to me now

Curse the rising tide  
A fisher of stormy seas  
When I cast the line,  
To What depth?  
Peering into my  
Every reality  
Fragile as the time  
That passes between each breath
