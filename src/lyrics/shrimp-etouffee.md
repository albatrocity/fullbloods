Face your true north now  
Can you keep it the same without a fight?  
Taste has faded out  
Do you think it can change your appetite?

Shrimp etouffee  
Easy going down  
Shrimp etouffee  
Look who's working now

Ain't that so high brow  
You just follow your own home recipe  
Bite the hand that feeds  
Because it is meat, man  
Tastes so good

You've got a full cup  
Drink it all up  
Steady diet of eating your own  
Just so you know
