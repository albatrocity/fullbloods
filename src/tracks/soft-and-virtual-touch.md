Bringing something up  
Takes a lot of guts  
To be honest in the face of  
Those who likely will replace you

Say just what you mean  
Safe behind a screen  
Do you take the risk of hearing  
Deeper echoes reappearing  
Or instead broadcast signals where they stand no chance of coming back to you?

Send that soft & virtual touch  
Keep that fragile confidence up
